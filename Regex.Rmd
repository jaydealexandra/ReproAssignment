#### Part I: Data Science  

Loads the dplyr package into memory 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Imports 'measurements.csv' into an object called 'MData'
```{r}
MData <- read.csv("measurements.csv")
```

Adds new column called 'Sp' that shortens the genus name in the Organism column to only the first letter and period
```{r}
MDataSp <- mutate(MData, Sp = tools::toTitleCase(sub("(\\w)\\w+", "\\1", sub("\\s",". ", Organism))))
```

Creates a new dataset called 'MeasShort' that includes only the columns Sp, limb width, limb length, and observer
```{r}
MeasShort <- select(MDataSp, Sp, Limb.width:Observer)
```

Saves 'MeasShort' as a file called 'MeasShort.csv'
```{r}
write.csv(MeasShort, 'MeasShort.csv')
```
